# valentine-tictactoe

Taking inspiration from a TikTok video, I decided to recreate the game in React for fun.

Here are some of the screenshots of the game:

<table border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; border: none;">
  <tr>
    <td style="border: none; padding: 0 10px;"><img src="./src/assets/main-screenshot.png" alt="Main Screen" width="250"/></td>
    <td style="border: none; padding: 0 10px;"><img src="./src/assets/game-screenshot.png" alt="Game Screen" width="250"/></td>
    <td style="border: none; padding: 0 10px;"><img src="./src/assets/result-screenshot.png" alt="Result Screen" width="250"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>
